# pdpditxx.9

I took what i wrote the first time and updated it to the latest version of iText and .net9. 

You can pass in a zip file with a .json config file, and that will be read in and chose what action you will take. 
You can merge/concatenate, split, save as (which does a little optimization), scale and rotate pages, make copies of a pdf (handy for testing things), and convert a PDF to text. 

I hope this helps someone out ! If you have improvements I'd love to know. 
Thanks !
